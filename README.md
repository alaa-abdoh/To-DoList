# 🔥 ToDo list App 🔥 
Welcome to my project! It's great to have you here. 😉 

The main goal of this project is to deal with the JavaScript language and functions and how to use them to make the website dynamic with the user.
Later, I made the same project, but with another interface and using ReactJS to notice the difference in writing the code and how it was smoother and easier when using the library.
In addition, any modification is stored in Local Storage so that the changes made by the user are saved since there is no data base and back-end end points.


Skills:HTML, CSS, JS
